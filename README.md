# search-tube
It is a youtube recommendation system which uses our chosen method for recommendation.

## Procedure
Using youtube api , we have to first get the search results . Sometimes there will be errors because of googles policy for restricting the useage of API . After sometimes it will be working fine . 
Then after getting the result we go through each link and crawl data form there and after getting all the desired data we assign points to different data and according to the data we show the result . Here comment analysis is also implemented.

## Note for viewers
It is console version of the project . I haven't uploaded the web version of it . If you want , can ask me for it . The web version is implemented in django.
